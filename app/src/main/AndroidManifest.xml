### Explanation of the Manifest Content:
1. **Application Declaration**: The manifest declares the application name, package, and theme, which are essential for Android to identify and style the app correctly.

2. **MainActivity**: This is where users will interact with the app, providing them access to all features related to social media management.

3. **AutomationService**: This background service is crucial for executing automation tasks automatically, allowing for continuous operation without user intervention.

4. **Permissions**: The necessary permissions are included to ensure proper functionality:
   - **INTERNET** is required to facilitate communication with social media APIs.
   - **ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** is used to monitor connectivity, ensuring that the app only attempts actions when online.
   - **READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** and **WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** enable the app to handle media files effectively, allowing users to schedule and manage posts with ease.

This configuration adheres to best practices for Android manifest declarations while focusing on the legitimate use cases of MadHub.
